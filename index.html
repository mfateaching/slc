									<p>
										Hello and welcome! I’m Afifa, and I’m delighted to share a little about my journey as a pre-primary educator. With 12 years of experience in nurturing young minds, I’m passionate about creating a warm, engaging, and stimulating environment for early learners.
									</p>

									<p>
										<B>My Philosophy <br /> </B>

										I believe that every child is unique and has their own way of discovering the world. My teaching approach is centered around fostering a love for learning through play, exploration, and creativity. I strive to build a supportive and inclusive classroom where children feel safe, valued, and excited to explore new concepts. <br />
									</p>

									<p>
										<B>Education & Experience <br /> </B>

										I hold a degree from Asian College Of Teachers and have completed Phonics training from Sparkle Academy . My experience ranges from teaching kids from pre & primary to 8th Standard. I’m constantly seeking new methods and strategies to enhance my teaching and stay updated with the latest in early childhood education. <br />
									</p>

									<p>
										<B>What to Expect <br /> </B>

										In our classroom, you can expect a vibrant mix of activities designed to stimulate young minds and encourage social and emotional growth. From hands-on projects and storytime to outdoor play and group activities, I ensure that each day is filled with learning opportunities that cater to diverse interests and developmental stages. <br />
									</p>

									<p>
										<B>Partnership with Parents <br /> </B>

										I believe that open communication between home and school is key to a child’s success. I’m committed to keeping parents informed and involved through regular updates, parent-teacher conferences, and collaborative events. <br />
									</p>

									<p>
										Thank you for visiting my site. I’m excited about the possibility of working with your child and being a part of their early learning journey. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to learn more about our program! <br />
